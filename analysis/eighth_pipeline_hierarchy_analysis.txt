Built specifically for the rental market without belts, chains, or gears, the Barreto 1324D features a 900lb frame with a low center of gravity to provide stability. The hydraulic chain motor is attached directly to the head shaft, and the outboard bearing is designed to protect the auger shaft from bending due to impacting rocks and debris. The control panel is simple and understandable, and the safety clutch engages and disengages the wheel and chain drive.\n",

Built to meet the needs of the residential contractor who may be working in tight spaces, this self propelled trencher can easily handle sprinkler systems, electrical lines, and other shallow trench applications. The 912HM saves on space while still providing the horsepower necessary to trench up to 24\" deep. The boom pivot design keeps high wear components out of the dirt and is easily maintained. The front end pivots on a pin instead of a boom pivot bushing, reducing maintenance issues caused by dirt and debris.\n",

The 1324STK is a smaller, more compact machine than the Barreto large track trenchers, allowing it to fit in tighter areas, while still reaching dig depths of 24-30\". The 1324STK features an innovative new track system and compact frame design that provides both stability and maneuverability. The floating track system utilizes independent undercarriage idlers that move in response to the terrain. The design keeps a significant portion of the track in contact with the terrain at all times, reducing ground pressure with increasing tension.",
