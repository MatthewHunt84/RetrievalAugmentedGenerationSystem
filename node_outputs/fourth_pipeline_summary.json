      "text_preview": "# Barreto Manufacturing, Inc.\n\n## Our History\n\n### A Revolutionary Idea\n\nIn 1982, Greg Barreto was a young father and a mechanic at a rental yard. He was frustrated with the constant repairs he faced when tillers came back from rentals. Having some natural engineering skills and having studied hydraulics, he knew there had to be a way to make a tougher tiller: one that was simple, rugged, durable, and able to stand up to the abuse of the rental market. He began to design and build. Months later, in his garage in Keizer, OR, Greg built the industry's first all-hydraulic tiller. He sold that tiller to the rental yard where he worked, and it continued to run at that location for more than 20 years. Greg and his wife Chris founded Barreto Manufacturing, Inc. in January of 1984.\n\nOver the next few years, word of the revolutionary new tiller spread. The company grew quickly from the garage to leased space in his brother's machine shop, until an opportunity presented to move to a larger warehouse across the state in La Grande. Barreto Manufacturing continues to be headquartered in La Grande today, with additional manufacturing and warehouse facilities in Idaho and South Carolina.\n\n## Leading the Industry\n\nWith the success of the all-hydraulic tiller, Greg began to look for other products on the market that would benefit from similar technology. Recognizing the challenges his customers faced with mechanically driven trenchers, his knowledge of hydraulics and desire to innovate paved the way for a long line of \"firsts\" in the trencher market:\n\n- The first compact all-hydraulic walk-behind trencher in 1995\n- The first all-hydraulic, self-propelled mini walk-behind trencher in 2005\n- The first all-hydraulic steerable walk-behind trencher in 2007\n- The first all-hydraulic automatic-drive micro trencher in 2010\n\nThrough the years, the Barreto line of equipment has grown to include stump grinders, log splitters, wood chippers, and mini-skid steers. Over 80% of the components that go into a Barreto piece of equipment are manufactured and powder coated in-house to ensure quality and reduce lead times for both equipment and replacement parts.\n\n## Your ROI\n\nGreg Barreto continues to lead Barreto Manufacturing and his strong commitment to design and quality in manufacturing are key in helping his customers enjoy the greatest return on investment and satisfaction in their equipment. Each piece of Barreto equipment is designed to excel in the most adverse conditions, without the downtime often experienced in harsh rental and industrial environments. Backed by the philosophy that in order for a company to be successful, its customers must be successful, Greg and his team strive to provide the best quality and service possible to the industries they serve.\n\n### Product Models\n\n- 1324D Trencher\n- 30SG Stump Grinder\n- 912HM Trencher\n- 920 Log Splitter",
