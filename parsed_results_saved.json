        "md": "# Barreto Manufacturing, Inc.\n\n## Our History\n\n### A Revolutionary Idea\n\nIn 1982, Greg Barreto was a young father and a mechanic at a rental yard. He was frustrated with the constant repairs he faced when tillers came back from rentals. Having some natural engineering skills and having studied hydraulics, he knew there had to be a way to make a tougher tiller: one that was simple, rugged, durable, and able to stand up to the abuse of the rental market. He began to design and build. Months later, in his garage in Keizer, OR, Greg built the industry's first all-hydraulic tiller. He sold that tiller to the rental yard where he worked, and it continued to run at that location for more than 20 years. Greg and his wife Chris founded Barreto Manufacturing, Inc. in January of 1984.\n\nOver the next few years, word of the revolutionary new tiller spread. The company grew quickly from the garage to leased space in his brother's machine shop, until an opportunity presented to move to a larger warehouse across the state in La Grande. Barreto Manufacturing continues to be headquartered in La Grande today, with additional manufacturing and warehouse facilities in Idaho and South Carolina.\n\n## Leading the Industry\n\nWith the success of the all-hydraulic tiller, Greg began to look for other products on the market that would benefit from similar technology. Recognizing the challenges his customers faced with mechanically driven trenchers, his knowledge of hydraulics and desire to innovate paved the way for a long line of \"firsts\" in the trencher market:\n\n- The first compact all-hydraulic walk-behind trencher in 1995\n- The first all-hydraulic, self-propelled mini walk-behind trencher in 2005\n- The first all-hydraulic steerable walk-behind trencher in 2007\n- The first all-hydraulic automatic-drive micro trencher in 2010\n\nThrough the years, the Barreto line of equipment has grown to include stump grinders, log splitters, wood chippers, and mini-skid steers. Over 80% of the components that go into a Barreto piece of equipment are manufactured and powder coated in-house to ensure quality and reduce lead times for both equipment and replacement parts.\n\n## Your ROI\n\nGreg Barreto continues to lead Barreto Manufacturing and his strong commitment to design and quality in manufacturing are key in helping his customers enjoy the greatest return on investment and satisfaction in their equipment. Each piece of Barreto equipment is designed to excel in the most adverse conditions, without the downtime often experienced in harsh rental and industrial environments. Backed by the philosophy that in order for a company to be successful, its customers must be successful, Greg and his team strive to provide the best quality and service possible to the industries they serve.\n\n### Product Models\n\n- 1324D Trencher\n- 30SG Stump Grinder\n- 912HM Trencher\n- 920 Log Splitter",

Till effectively in small spaces with the 18\" tilling width on this model. The open design provides easy access to the hydraulics when maintaining or repairing. The unique swivel handlebar featured on this compact unit means you can walk alongside your tiller rather than in your freshly tilled earth. The heavy design means your tiller works for you instead of tossing you around. Counter-rotating tines break up the most difficult soil, clay, or sod. Wheels and tines work independently of each other to allow your tilling travel speed to be adjusted to the soil conditions.\n\nMulti-position handlebar increases operational height comfort\n\n## Controls\n\nThe operator-friendly controls couldn't be easier: one handle to set the tine drive and one to adjust the wheel drive. Engage the clutch lever, use the variable speed drive to adjust the ground speed, and engage the tines when you are ready to till. If you need to stop for a moment, drop the clutch and the tines and wheels will stop, leaving your engine running and ready to pick up where you left off.\n\nSimple controls are easy to learn and easy to operate\n\n### Features:\n- Pivoting handlebar allows closer tilling along houses or fence lines\n- 18\" tilling width\n- Counter-rotating tines cut through sod and hard-packed soil\n- Hubs unlock to free-wheel the tiller when the engine isn't running\n\n## Recommended Trailer\n\nE3X4TBT Tilt Bed Trailer\n\nManufactured by BARRETO\nwww.barretomfg.com",

The hydraulic chain motor is attached directly to the head shaft, and the outboard bearing is designed to protect the auger shaft from bending due to impacting rocks and debris. The control panel is simple and understandable, and the safety clutch engages and disengages the wheel and chain drive.\n\n## 912HM Mini Trencher:\nIn 2005, Barreto brought the first all-hydraulic, self-propelled mini walk-behind trencher to the rental market with the introduction of the 912HM Mini Trencher. Built to meet the needs of the residential contractor who may be working in tight spaces, this self propelled trencher can easily handle sprinkler systems, electrical lines, and other shallow trench applications. The 912HM saves on space while still providing the horsepower necessary to trench up to 24\" deep. The boom pivot design keeps high wear components out of the dirt and is easily maintained. The front end pivots on a pin instead of a boom pivot bushing, reducing maintenance issues caused by dirt and debris.\n\n## 712MT Micro Trencher:\nThe Barreto line of walk-behind trenchers also includes the 712MT Micro Trencher, introduced to the rental market in 2010, and it is the trencher with instincts. The 712MT features a load sensing valve system that automatically adjusts the wheel speed to the trenching conditions. When the digging chain requires more power, the wheel speed slows without having to adjust any of the controls. Perfect for the novice, easy for the professional.\n\n## 2024RTK Track Trencher:\nThe 2024RTK Stand-on Track Trencher from Barreto was released in 2015 and features a fixed platform and unique fine tuning control adjustment that uses rod linkage instead of cables. The new Adjustable Trenching Control (ATC) can be placed into position to modify the trenching speed of the tracks individually while on the go. Individual track controls can be adjusted separately during operation allowing the operator to keep their trench straight when working on uneven terrain.\n\n## 1324STK Track Trencher:\nThe newest addition to the Barreto family of trenchers is the 1324STK walk-behind track trencher developed in 2017 as a response to customer demand for a smaller track trencher. The 1324STK is a smaller, more compact machine than the Barreto large track trenchers, allowing it to fit in tighter areas, while still reaching dig depths of 24-30\". The 1324STK features an innovative new track system and compact frame design that provides both stability and maneuverability. The floating track system utilizes independent undercarriage idlers that move in response to the terrain. The design keeps a significant portion of the track in contact with the terrain at all times, reducing ground pressure with increasing tension.",

It is also effective in clay or \"gumbo\" soil that is sticky and clings to the chain.\n\n## DOUBLE CUP CHAIN\nThis chain has a cup tooth on every link.\n### Where to use it:\nThe Double Cup Chain is best for sand or dry, loose soil that has a tendency to fall back into the trench. The extra cups provide for better trench clean-out.\n\n## COMBO/SHARK CHAIN\nThis chain has an alternating pattern of cup and shark teeth.\n### Where to use it:\nThe Combo/Shark Chain is designed for areas with variable soil types. The shark teeth are effective in rocky soil or hard pan while the cups provide for efficient trench clean-out. This chain continues to be aggressive even as the cups get rounded. This is our most commonly sold chain.\n\n## BOLT-ON SHARK CHAIN\nThis chain utilizes a standard chain blank and has shark teeth bolted to the blank.\n### Where to use it:\nThe Bolt-On Shark Chain is good in rocky soil, limestone, hardpan, and any other hard-to-dig soils. It does not clean out well in sandy, dry, loose, or loamy soil. The teeth can be removed when the chain wears out and can be used on a new blank. It is not uncommon for the teeth to last through two chains.\n\n## WELDED SHARK CHAIN\nThe teeth on this chain are all shark teeth that are welded onto the chain. Replacement teeth are not available for this chain.\n### Where to use it:\nThe Welded Shark Chain can be used in the most adverse soils. It is good in rocky soil, limestone, hardpan, and any other hard-to-dig soils. It does not clean out well in sandy, dry, loose, or loamy soil. This is not the fastest chain, but it is the most durable. It is not uncommon for the teeth to outlast the chain rollers. When the rollers wear out, the complete chain must be replaced.\n\nNOTE: Chains are available in 6\" widths on full-size trenchers.\n\n### Models shown:\n- 718MTH\n- 1324D\n- 1321STK\n- 2024RTK\n\nManufacturer: BARRETO\nWebsite: www.barretomfg.com",

        "md": "# 712MTH MICRO TRENCHER\n\n## Design\n\nThe 712MT micro trencher features a unique automatic wheel drive propulsion system. This trencher utilizes a load-sensing hydraulic valve to adjust the trenching wheel speed to the load on the digging chain. When the load on the digging chain increases, the sensing valve sends less oil to the wheel drive motor and the wheel speed will automatically slow down. When the load on the digging chain decreases, the sensing valve sends more oil to the wheel drive motor and the wheel drive speed will automatically increase. This keeps a constant load on the engine, regardless of the depth of cut or differing soil conditions. Not only does this help the trencher run at optimal efficiency, it reduces stress on the components, increasing their longevity.\n\n### Key Features:\n- Load sensing valve automatically adjusts wheel speed to digging conditions\n- Made in the USA\n\n## Controls\n\nThe automatic adjustment to the wheel drive motor eliminates the responsibility on the operator to constantly adjust their wheel speed. Nothing could be easier for the novice user. One control lever operates the wheel drive and one lever operates the chain drive. After engaging the chain drive lever, the operator just engages the wheel drive lever and lets the trencher do the work. When the wheel drive is in forward, the chain drive will not activate, eliminating costly repairs sometimes caused by inexperienced operators.\n\n### Key Features:\n- Simple controls are easy for even the most novice operator\n- Two-lever operation system\n\n## Specifications\n\n- Hydraulic drive motor provides self-propelled trenching\n- 12\" or 18\" digging depth\n- 3.5\" or 4.5\" digging width\n- Free wheeling hubs allow the operator to transport without the engine running\n\n## Recommended Trailer\n\nE3X4DGT Drop Gate Trailer\n\n----\n\nManufactured by BARRETO\nwww.barretomfg.com",

To meet the needs of the residential contractor who may be working in tight spaces, this self-propelled trencher can easily handle sprinkler systems, electrical lines, and other shallow trench applications. The 912 saves on space while still providing the horsepower necessary to trench up to 24\" deep. The boom pivot design keeps high wear components out of the dirt and is easily maintained. The front end pivots on a pin instead of a boom pivot bushing. This reduces maintenance issues often caused by dirt and debris.\n\nThe innovative boom pivot design keeps the pivot pin out of the dirt\n\n## Controls\n\nThe control panel is simple and understandable for even the novice operator. The safety clutch engages and disengages the wheel and chain drives. When the clutch is released, the engine continues to run and the controls remain in place, ready to resume trenching at any time. Variable speed drive allows the operator to adjust their wheel speed to the soil conditions. The reversible chain drive can be operated manually to dislodge obstructions or debris.\n\nReversible chain can be manually operated to dislodge debris\n\nSimple controls are easy to operate with no color codes to remember\n\n### Specifications\n\n- Reliable hydraulic design keeps efficiency high and maintenance low\n- 12\", 18\", or 24\" digging depth\n- 4\" or 6\" digging width\n- The innovative boom pivot design keeps the pivot pin out of the dirt\n\n## Recommended Trailer\n\nE4X6TBT-912 Tilt Bed Trailer\n\nManufactured by BARRETO\nwww.barretomfg.com",

The innovative track system and compact frame design provide both stability and maneuverability. A hydraulic cooler with incorporated fan keeps the oil temperatures regulated. Electric start is standard on all models. Efficient and functional, the STK is the perfect addition to any trencher fleet.\n\n*Hydraulic pumps are protected yet accessible*\n\n## Controls\n\nThe STK features our Adjustable Trenching Controls (ATC) that use rod linkage instead of cables. The ATC can be positioned to modify the trenching speed of the tracks individually while on the go. By utilizing the individual track controls, the operator has the ability to keep their trench straight when working on uneven terrain.\n\n*Simple controls are easy to operate*\n\n## Independent Floating Track System\n\nThe floating track system utilizes independent undercarriage idlers that move in response to the terrain. This design keeps a significant portion of the track in contact with the terrain at all times, reducing ground pressure and increasing traction. The movement of the middle and rear idlers act as suspension and smooth the overall movement of the trencher. This provides for a more fluid operation than traditional track trenchers when working in rough and uneven conditions.\n\n### Specifications\n- 24\" or 30\" digging depth\n- 4\" or 6\" digging width\n- Trencher chain adjustment\n- Rod linkage instead of cables\n- Adjustable Trenching Controls\n\n## Recommended Trailer\n\nE4X6TBT-STK Tilt Bed Trailer\n\n*Manufactured by BARRETO*\nwww.barretomfg.com",

        "md": "# 13SGH/16SGB MINI STUMP GRINDER\n\n## Design\n\nSmall but mighty, the Barreto 13SG/16SG stump grinder is a true workhorse. This stump grinder's unique design pivots over the center line of the wheels, allowing the grinding head to sweep easily across the stump, while the wheel base remains stationary. Engine options include the Honda GX390 or the 16hp Briggs & Stratton Vanguard V-Twin. The innovative design and compact stature of this stump grinder makes it ideal for tight access areas. The swivel head has a swing arc of 35\u00b0 and the cutting wheel has eight carbide Greenteeth\u00a9 with three cutting surfaces.

The 30SG has a hydraulically-driven cutter wheel that is raised and lowered into the stump and then moved from side to side to cut down. The 30SG is powered by either a 31hp Briggs & Stratton Vanguard V-Twin engine or a Honda GX800 engine. The engine is coupled to two gear pumps: the larger gear pump drives the cutter wheel and the smaller pump works the tilt and swing cylinders.

Counterbalance valves on each track drive prevent the track motors from slipping while the cutter wheel is engaged in the cutting process, even while operating on a slope.\n\n### Key Features:\n- Hydraulically driven, center-mounted cutter wheel provides 134\u00b0 head swing\n- Time-tested track design absorbs impact and provides stability\n- Sixteen 700 series carbide Greenteeth\u00a9 with three cutting surfaces\n\n## Controls\n\nThe cutter wheel operation and articulating arm are operated by controls mounted on the console. The cutter wheel is activated by a switch on the control stick and has a secondary safety switch to prevent accidental engagement.

The 37SG is powered by a 37hp Briggs & Stratton Vanguard V-Twin EFI engine. The engine is coupled to two piston pumps: the larger piston pump delivers fluid to a piston motor that drives the cutter wheel, while the cylinders, lift, and swing are supplied with fluid from an auxiliary pump that is mounted to the main piston pump. The tracks are driven by independent hydrostatic pumps mounted on the rear of the engine for easy access and simple linkage control. Counterbalance valves on each track drive prevent the track motors from slipping while the cutter wheel is engaged in the cutting process, even while operating on a slope. The track drive increases maneuverability around the jobsite, allowing the job to get done with increased efficiency.\n\nGreenteeth\u00ae LoPro 900 Series teeth are durable, hardworking, and have three usable surfaces.\n\n### Controls\n\nThe 37SG track drive, articulating arm, and cutter wheel control are operated by console-mounted controls. A control stick with a switch operates the cutter wheel, and it is equipped with a secondary safety switch to prevent accidental engagement. The control stick also controls the back and forth movement across the stump. Depth of cut is easily controlled with a lever. Two track drive controls allow for independent control of each track.\n\nThe engine is coupled to two pumps: a larger piston pump drives the cutter wheel and a smaller pump works the tilt and swing.\n\nSixteen 900 series carbide Greenteeth\u00ae with three cutting surfaces.\n\n### Recommended Trailer\n\nE4X6TBT-SG Tilt Bed Trailer\n\nFor more information: www.barretomfg.com",

        "md": "# 3107C CHIPPER\n\n## Design\n\nPowered by either a 31hp Briggs & Stratton Vanguard V-Twin engine or a Honda GX800 engine, both with electric start, the Barreto 3107C Chipper utilizes a series of load-sensing valves to optimize material feed. As the load on the feed system increases, or as the chipper flywheel slows, the feed rate will automatically adapt to allow the flywheel to maintain maximum RPM. The feed wheel and motor are mounted to a tensioned pivot-arm system. The arms pivot on heavy-duty composite bushings instead of the plastic wear slides commonly used by machines of similar size. Designed to chip up to 7\" diameter wood material, the chipper features two double-sided knives. All grease points are situated in a central location to facilitate easy greasing and servicing.\n\n## Controls\n\nThe operator safety bar allows for the manual start, stop, and reverse of the feed wheel, and the yellow safety bumper bar across the front of the feed chute provides an emergency stop. The Barreto 3107C Chipper is ready to tow with a standard 2,900 lb torsion axle and quick release coupling. It also has a bolt-on tongue which is removable and replaceable in the event it becomes damaged.\n\n### Safety Features\n\n- Operator safety bars allow for the manual start, stop, and reverse of the feed wheel, and the yellow safety bumper bar provides an emergency stop\n- Safety switch to prevent the engine from being started while the blades are exposed\n- Safety bumper bar\n\n### Key Components\n\n- Multi-position discharge chute\n- Torsion axle suspension\n- Centralized manifold with grease points to facilitate easy greasing and servicing\n\nThe Barreto 3107C Chipper is a robust machine designed for efficient wood chipping operations with a focus on safety and ease of maintenance.",
